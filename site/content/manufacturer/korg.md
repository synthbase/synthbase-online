## Corporate Self-description

Since it was founded in 1963, Korg's goal has been to create new experiences in music and performance. That was what drove the creation of Japan's first disc-based rhythm machine, the Doncamatic, and then led to the development of Japanâ€™s first synthesizer and the world's first needle-type tuner, followed by numerous unique instruments that have brought the enjoyment of musical performance to many people all around the world.

Korg is resolved to continue to create innovative and uncompromising instruments which maintain the high quality that inspires professional artists and creators, and yet are approachable enough for anyone to play. The musical instruments Korg will deliver are reflections of the ideas and values of the many artists and users who continue to love Korg products - now and into the future.
